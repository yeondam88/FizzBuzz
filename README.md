# FizzBuzz (Thinkful Project)

<h4>This project used the following skills : HTML, CSS, Javascript</h4>

In this project, creating an original game of Fizz buzz.

How it works
  1. You count from 1 to a given number ( Let's say 100)
  2. Each number if it's not divisible by 3 or 5, you simply say the number.
  3. If it's divisible by 3, istead of the number you say "Fizz".
  4. If it's divisible by 5, instead of the number you say "Buzz".
  5. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "Fizz Buzz"
